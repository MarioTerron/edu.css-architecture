> “Progressive enhancement is about building robust products and being paranoid about availability. It is about asking “if” a lot. That starts even before you think about your interface.”

> “Progressive enhancement in its basic form means not making assumptions but start with the most basic thing and check every step on the way if we are still OK to proceed.”
> - _Chris Heilmann_

Don't break the web.

Pensar el Progressive enchancement como una especie de Error Handling. Pero lo que estamos gestionando no son errores sino la enorme diversidad intrínseca a la web.

> “We continuously sacrifice robustness of our products for developer convenience. We’re not the ones using our products. It doesn’t make sense to save time and effort for us when the final product fails to deliver because of a single error.”

> “We just don’t know for sure what the future looks like, so it’s best to work with web standards instead of fighting against them.”
